## 2021.2.1 - 2021/02/21

- Fix `ResourceWarning: unclosed ssl.SSLSocket`

## 2021.2 - 2021/01/19

	"647+smiling_face_with_3_hearts+ðŸ¥°" followed by the file extension (requires
	`emoji` for this)

	speed increase

## 2021.1.5 - 2021/01/13

- Update `pylottie` for significant speed improvements (animation renders take
	approx 2/3 as long)
- Leverage the quality setting exposed by `pylottie` to further improve speed if
	desired (quality 0 is fastest, quality 3 is best quality)

## 2021.1.3 - 2021/01/13

- Use `pylottie` to convert animated stickers increasing processing speed by about 10%
- Can pass in packs with `-p` or `--pack`
